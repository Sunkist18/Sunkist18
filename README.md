## 💼 Growth at a Startup
> 2023.09 ~ Present, **Backend Developer** at [Mockingbird](https://mockingbird.co.kr/)

<img src="about/mockingbird.png" width="500" />

I’m currently a backend developer at **Mockingbird**, where I lead and contribute to various projects:

- **080 Opt-Out Integration**: Integrated an 080 opt-out feature into our text messaging system (Spring framework), reducing spam and improving trust.  
- **Payment & Cart System**: Built a cart and payment flow (Spring + Toss Payments API), enhancing user experience and revenue.  
- **Server Stabilization & Optimization**: Scaled and redesigned a heavily-loaded exam-generation server, reducing processing time by **up to 50x**.  
- **Coupon Feature**: Designed a DB schema and developed a coupon creation/management feature in Spring, boosting marketing initiatives.

> **Server Stabilization & Optimization**:  
> A sudden Twitter viral post caused a massive traffic spike, resulting in server overload. We expanded our infrastructure and introduced object reuse strategies, achieving much-improved performance and reliability.

While at **Mockingbird**, I’ve also worked on **B2B projects**, collaborating with various clients:

- **Mockingbird B2B SaaS Exam Demo**:  
  Developed a Windows-based **Django server** for a B2B SaaS solution. Closely coordinated with the backend team on APIs and DB design.
  
- **개념원리 Korean Converter**:  
  Collaborated with **개념원리** to build an API-based tool converting **HTML** to **HWPX**. Utilized **Python**, **Django**, and a custom **LaTeX2HANTEX** library.   
  Thorough documentation and iterative feedback ensured a successful project.
  
- **Hidden KICE Scoring Platform**:  
  Led backend development and database design. Deployed on AWS with DNS integration for high availability. Close communication with clients ensured precise requirement fulfillment.
  
- **시대인재 AI Subtitling Service**:  
  Single-handedly developed a large-scale **MP4 → Whisper API → SRT** subtitle generation pipeline. Tackled the 25MB API limit by splitting audio, parallel processing, and re-aligning timestamps. The resulting workflow drastically cut costs and time, earning praise for reliability and automation depth.

> These B2B projects have sharpened my **collaboration** and **project management** skills. I experienced the full development cycle—from requirement analysis to deployment and feedback—making me a more business-oriented developer.
